# Podcast marketing

It doesn't matter how much I like you or respect you, I still won't see/listen to the embedded ads on your show, if I don't have to. But podcast ads are different. They feel like a personal message from the host and is a natural extension of the episode that I am listening to, especially if it's a mid-roll placement. My opinion of a brand goes up because a particular person is endorsing them. I feel like there's some personal opinion involved and since I respect that person's opinion, I pay heed to it. It's like your friend who has already used a particular product is giving their opinion. It's more trustworthy and I am more likely to act on it than an ad, however funny or moving I find it to be. 

My personal opinion is validated by market research. Podcast marketing is a fast growing segment which is expected to reach $1 billion market by 2021, up from just about $500 million in 2018, a CAGR of 44%. Claritas has released a report on results of analyzing over 158 podcast campaigns. It states that 55% of podcast listeners pay attentino to advertisements and over 45% of listeners have high household income of above $250,000.

It enables focused delivery and option to choose your audience. It helps tap unrealized potential, as it has the ability to attract passive audience, convert passive audience to active visitors/buyers, as against a paid search/PLA ad that requires the audience to take the first step. I don't know about you, but I am biased towards the very first brand I come across a particular product/service. For example, there may be lots of better service providers, but Hello fresh is something that I intrinsically lean towards.It will take a lot more convincing to make me switch to another brand, even if it has better offerings. It's not entirely rational, but hey, humans aren't rational most of the time. 

With all these great attributes, podcast as a marketing channel should not be overlooked just because it is not straightforward to attribute clicks to an ad. The time lapse between when a subscriber downloaded a podcast episode and visited the site can be a good indicator, combined with an analysis of other traffic coming in to the site and comparing them.

Measuring Incrementality for any marketing channel is imperative to make decisions on optimal allocation of resources. 

# What is incrementality?

Incrementality is that marginal effect on traffic or revenue or profit, however you measure your KPIs, that introducing this marketing channel has, all other factors remaining the same. This incremental portion is not expected to have realized if not for this channel. 

# Measuring incremental lift of podcast marketing

The most reliable way to measure incremental effect in marketing industry is through A/B testing. Select a group of audience randomly, based on pre-determined criteria, ideally reflecting the average customer-base (existing or potential, depending on the objective of the test). split them into control and test groups. The control group will not have the ads in the episodes they download. the test group will. compare the difference in traffic/revenue and/or other KPIs between the two groups. did the test group drive more traffic than the control group? did the test group show characteristics of a high intent audience vs the control group? if the answer is yes, then there you have your answer. there is incremental effect and the numbers can be easily measured. But this is not always possible in podcast marketing for the following reasons:

- Offline channel - not able to track the clicks from podcast show. 
- Can be tracked using promotional codes. but not entirely reliable if the person doesn't use the code. Also, the promo codes will help only when an order is placed. It is not helpful to track and analyze site traffic, especially of those who don't convert
- Baked-in ads in podcast doesn't allow for change or splitting audience into buckets. we don't have control over who sees the ads or don't and as such, can't run experiements readily on them. Dynamic ads on the other hand, are very flexible and it is possible to set up experiments, although the revenue stream will start to dwindle and eventually stop with passage of time.
