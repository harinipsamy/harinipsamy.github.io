Measuring Incrementality for any marketing channel is imperative to make decisions on optimal allocation of resources. As mentioned in a [previous post](https://harinipsamy.github.io/2020/09/24/podcast-marketing/), having podcast in your marketing portfolio is beneficial. Just as in any other channel, it is important to measure the incremental effect to ascertain the effect it has on the overall marketing strategy of the business and ensure optimal allocation of resources. 

# What is incrementality?

Incrementality is that marginal effect on traffic or revenue or profit, however you measure your KPIs, that introducing this marketing channel has, all other factors remaining the same. This incremental portion is not expected to have realized if not for this channel. 

# Measuring incremental lift of podcast marketing

The most reliable way to measure incremental effect in marketing industry is through A/B testing. Select a group of audience randomly, based on pre-determined criteria, ideally reflecting the average customer-base (existing or potential, depending on the objective of the test). split them into control and test groups. The control group will not have the ads in the episodes they download. the test group will. compare the difference in traffic/revenue and/or other KPIs between the two groups. did the test group drive more traffic than the control group? did the test group show characteristics of a high intent audience vs the control group? if the answer is yes, then there you have your answer. there is incremental effect and the numbers can be easily measured. But this is not always possible in podcast marketing for the following reasons:

- Offline channel - not able to track the clicks from podcast show. 
- Can be tracked using promotional codes. but not entirely reliable if the person doesn't use the code. Also, the promo codes will help only when an order is placed. It is not helpful to track and analyze site traffic, especially of those who don't convert
- Baked-in ads in podcast doesn't allow for change or splitting audience into buckets. we don't have control over who sees the ads or don't and as such, can't run experiements readily on them. Dynamic ads on the other hand, are very flexible and it is possible to set up experiments, although the revenue stream will start to dwindle and eventually stop with passage of time.
