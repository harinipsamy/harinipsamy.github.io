explicit estimation of returns using returns and volatility - very noisy. therefore, we use drivers or mean returns and volatility for modeling.

factor: list of numerical values - one for each stock - predictive of an aspect of performance of the stock in the future. 

what does a factor look like? a simple formulation of a factor: 
a momentum factor: H0: 1 yr return indicates momentum for the next few days ->

factor in this example: collection of 1 yr return for a set of stocks over time 
how is factor used: use the factor value of each stocks to compare with other stocks in the universe. Its difficult to use them as weights, as it contains a lot of noise. 

Standardizing - why is it done


alpha factors : drivers of mean returns
risk factors : drivers of volatility

factors can be based on: momentum, fundamental info, signals frm social media. - process them in a way that is predictive of future movement of stocks
