# Podcast marketing

It doesn't matter how much I like you or respect you, I still won't see/listen to the embedded ads on your show, if I don't have to. But podcast ads are different. They feel like a personal message from the host and is a natural extension of the episode that I am listening to, especially if it's a mid-roll placement. My opinion of a brand goes up because a particular person is endorsing them. I feel like there's some personal opinion involved and since I respect that person's opinion, I pay heed to it. It's like your friend who has already used a particular product is giving their opinion. It's more trustworthy and I am more likely to act on it than an ad, however funny or moving I find it to be. 

My personal opinion is validated by market research. Podcast marketing is a fast growing segment which is expected to reach $1 billion market by 2021, up from just about $500 million in 2018, a CAGR of 44%. Claritas has released a report on results of analyzing over 158 podcast campaigns. It states that 55% of podcast listeners pay attention to advertisements, and over 45% of listeners have high household income of above $250,000.

It enables focused delivery and option to choose your audience. It helps tap unrealized potential, as it has the ability to attract passive audience, convert passive audience to active visitors/buyers, as against a paid search/PLA ad that requires the audience to take the first step. I don't know about you, but I am biased towards the very first brand I come across a particular product/service. For example, there may be lots of better service providers, but Hello fresh is something that I intrinsically lean towards. It will take a lot more convincing to make me switch to another brand, even if it has better offerings. It's not entirely rational, but hey, humans aren't rational most of the time. 

With all these great attributes, podcast as a marketing channel should not be overlooked just because it is not straightforward to attribute clicks to an ad. The time lapse between when a subscriber downloaded a podcast episode and visited the site can be a good indicator to track the performance of the channel, combined with an analysis of other traffic coming in to the site and comparing them.


# Podcast marketing - how it's done

The show hosts air ads that are either baked-in to the pdocast episode, or dynamically inserted while the listener plays the epidsode. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Baked-in ads are considered a part of the episode and stays on the episode file forever. It has the advantage that the listeners find the transition into ads seemless, as the hosts weave it into the conversation. It also means that the advertiser may realize revenue as long as the episode is listened to, even years after the advertiser paid for the ad. They cannot be modified after the episode is released. Dynamic ads, on the other hand, are ads that are inserted into the slots alloted for ads at the time a podcast is played. Dynamic ads offer the advantage of the ad being relevant whenever the listener plays the episode. The ads can be changed as per the change in circumstances. The hosts have the opportunity to realize additional ad revenue for the same episode, if it is listened to long after it was released. The advertisers will stop realizing sale of their products after a time-period, as the ads will not be aired forever. The type of ads that your organization should prefer will depend upon the type of products, market interest, etc., but it's good to have both in your marketing campaign.

The placement of the ads also play a role in capturing attention of the audience. The ads can be placed pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll. Pre-roll ads are aired at the beginning of the episode, mid-roll, during, and post-roll, at the end of the episode. Mid-roll ads may have slightly more attention of the audience compared to pre-roll and post-roll.

Payment for ads are usually based on the number of impressions that an episode can generate, and it's not unusual for the podcast show to make good on the impressions promised by continuing to air the ad on future episodes if the numbers doesn't reach the target.


# Data Collection

Collecting user data of people coming from podcast marketing channel can be challenging, as it is an offline marketing channel and it is not straigthforward to track the source of the visit, based on just the url. However, what is trackable is when an user downloads the podcast episode and the time lapse between the download and the user's visit to the product site.

# Benefits

Although the performance of podcast marketing is difficult to measure, it should be considered as an integral part of brand building and marketing. It may indirectly drive traffic to site through other marketing channels.
