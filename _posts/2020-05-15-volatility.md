Volatility is a measure of risk and Characterizes variability in returns. What level of returns can an investor expect on an average, and how often and by how much the returns will differ from that average.

## Calculation

Volatility in the stock-market is simply how much a stock's price deviates from the mean. Therefore, it can be calculated as the standard deviation of log returns:

Volatility does not distinguish between good and bad performance, and both positive and negative deviations will be considered the same way. A stock performing significantly better than the other stocks in the stock universe will be treated the same as a stock performing considerably worse.
