Optimization involves finding maximum or minimum of a funtion. A Maximization problem can be converted to a minimization problem by optimizing for the negative of a function.

## Finding Minimum 

At the point where the function is minimum, the slope is 0. At all other points, the slope is either some positive or negative number.

By setting the derivative of the function to 0 and solving for x, we can find the minimum point.


### Local minimum

To distinguish between minima/maxima or saddle points, we can use the second derivative test:
if `f"(x_0)`
