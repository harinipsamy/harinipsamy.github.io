  about: " Machine Learning intertwines my life as a Data Scientist by day and Investor by night.<br/><br/>

I am a Software Development Manager with a strong business and programming background resulting from work experience across multiple industries with focus on applied Machine Learning (ML).<br/>
Recipient of Entrepreneurship Award for championing new initiatives by School of Management at University at Buffalo, I build ML models to interpret and predict customer behavior to enhance marketing strategies. <br/><br/>

I strive to document my adventures in data science and trading/investing using Machine learning techniques and my learning in this space.<br/>\n

"


I am trained in Indian classical dance and music. When I am not building models or devicing investment strategies, I like to try my hand at painting or play Bach on the piano. I also love the adrenaline rush when I am competing with friends in a game of badminton or ping-pong - or any other game for that matter."
